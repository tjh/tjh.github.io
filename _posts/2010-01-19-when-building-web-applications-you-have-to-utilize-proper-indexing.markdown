Rails does a lot of crazy wonderful stuff. The downside is that all that awesome power gives you the ability to make some pretty dumb moves. Just because I can get the URL for one of the sites my [Am I Down?](http://www.AmIDownHQ.com/) users get alerts for by using...[ruby language="light=&quot;true"]current_user.sites[0].host.url[/ruby]...doesn't mean that I necessarily should. That command generates some heavy SQL, running a join across several tables (after running a separate query to get the current user):[sql]SELECT &quot;subscriptions&quot;.&quot;id&quot; AS t0_r0, &quot;subscriptions&quot;.&quot;user_id&quot; AS t0_r1, &quot;subscriptions&quot;.&quot;host_id&quot; AS t0_r2, &quot;subscriptions&quot;.&quot;alert_id&quot; AS t0_r3, &quot;subscriptions&quot;.&quot;created_at&quot; AS t0_r4, &quot;subscriptions&quot;.&quot;updated_at&quot; AS t0_r5, &quot;hosts&quot;.&quot;id&quot; AS t1_r0, &quot;hosts&quot;.&quot;url&quot; AS t1_r1, &quot;hosts&quot;.&quot;created_at&quot; AS t1_r2, &quot;hosts&quot;.&quot;updated_at&quot; AS t1_r3 FROM &quot;subscriptions&quot; LEFT OUTER JOIN &quot;hosts&quot; ON &quot;hosts&quot;.id = &quot;subscriptions&quot;.host_id WHERE (&quot;subscriptions&quot;.user_id = 35) ORDER BY subscriptions.updated_at DESC, hosts.url ASC[/sql]That's going to take 21ms to run, just for a lookup. Is that a big deal? Perhaps not. Indexes (in the right situations) may make that SQL query run at an acceptable level.Real world problems===In the case of [Am I Down?](http://www.AmIDownHQ.com/), my service that alerts you when your web sites go down, I run some pretty slick lookups back through the logs for a web site to see if the change we see in a sites' status is significant enough to warrant an alert. Since there are thousands of web site checks going on every hour (currently over 20,000 each day), a 21ms SQL statement is seriously bad. You can see the result below:[![20100119-db-indexing-screenshot](http://timharvey.net/wp-content/20100119_db_indexing_screenshot.png)](http://timharvey.net/wp-content/20100119_db_indexing_screenshot_full.png)The solution===The logging table didn't have an index on the host_id, so it took forever (20ms or so) to find only the log entries for the current host, which for various reasons happens 8-10 times per check. So almost a 1/4 second is taken up by SQL checks every time I checked a site. You do the math and that means you can only sustain about 1,200 sites (240 checks per minute, every 5 min) for each checking worker. Not good.You'll see that the there's a vertical bar towards the right of the graph, after which the bars drop off considerably. That would be the point I added an index for the host_id. Suddenly the time drops to about 3ms. That's more like 3,600 sites for each checking worker. Much better!Improving your Rails app===For a Rails app, the [Rails_Indexes](http://github.com/eladmeidar/rails_indexes) plugin offers a great way to track down any obvious indexes you may be missing. To speed up queries and reduce the number of queries you make, take a look at [Bullet](http://github.com/flyerhzm/bullet).
