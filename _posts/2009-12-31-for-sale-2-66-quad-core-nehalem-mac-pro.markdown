Therefore, it no longer makes sense for me to maintain a monster-powered Mac Pro at my office. Heck, I'm only in the office one or two days now.For Sale - Like-new [Mac Pro with AppleCare](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R84UQ0/ref=ox_ya_oh_product):- 2.66 GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon "Nehalem" processor
