I am constantly on the lookout for ideal clients. I yearn to surround myself with them. The people I look for:
* Possess an enthusiastic attitude and enjoy coming to work every day
* Want to delight their customers with excellent service and fantastic products
* Love to learn, looking to improve themselves and their craft
* Focus on building lasting value at the expense of immediate gratification* Value quality time with family and friends, avoiding the workaholic trend!

If that's you, I expect you to contact me in the next 2 minutes. You'll find a [wealth of contact details](http://www.literacy5.com/page/contacts/) on my [company web site](http://www.literacy5.com/).

# But what do you do?

"But Tim," I hear you say, "You didn't say anything about the work you do." That's true, and very intentional. While most of my work ends up being technology-related, and specifically web site development, what separates my from any other developer sits outside the technology realm.It's about giving my customers **peace of mind**. I'm the guy who my clients (and previous employers) turn to when the game is on the line and they need to score (pardon the sports analogy, it's all I could come up with). While it may sound cliche, I make things happen. Yes, **I build killer web sites and online software**. They're perfect for my clients not because the technology is great. It's that they do what no one else could figure out how to do: accomplish my client's goals of more revenue, more customers, fewer errors, etc.The people I work with have problems they need solved, and never enough time to take care of everything. They're frustrated when working with people who need to be told what to do, or how to do it. There just isn't enough time in the day.I'm the guy who comes in and wants to know, "Where do you want to be in 6-12 months?" and "What issues plague your organization?" I sniff out the solutions to those problems, present my plan of action, and then get it done. My clients rest easy at night knowing that **I'm sweating the details** and **taking responsibility** for delivering success.

# You did what?

Some of the quirky projects my clients (and previous employers) have put me up against include:
* **Managing the planning and execution of a national trade show exhibit** -- Increased dealer network by 20% within 9 months
* **Revamping a manual, fax-based ordering system** -- In less than a year, over 90% of customers chose to use the web-based system I created
* **Writing a "For Dummies" book** -- Researched and wrote over half of "[Developing eBay Business Tools For Dummies](http://www.amazon.com/Developing-Business-Dummies-Personal-Finance/dp/0764579061/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1255698222&sr=8-1)", a beginners guide to API connectivity for eBay, PayPal, FedEx, and UPS.
* **Completely rebranded a confused, aging company** -- Within months, salespeople were jumping for joy over the new materials and focus on a single consistent message
* **Building online shipping software service ShipperTools.com** -- Designed, developed, and implemented [ShipperTools](http://shippertools.com), [recommended](http://books.google.com/books?q=shippertools+ebay+timesaving+techniques+for+dummies&btnG=Search+Books) in  a [bunch](http://books.google.com/books?q=shippertools+starting+an+ebay+business+for+dummies&btnG=Search+Books) of [online](http://books.google.com/books?id=U5FeLQqXZP0C&pg=PA261&lpg=PA261&dq=%22shippertools.com%22&source=bl&ots=my9PNQhmfc&sig=OiukMCB-gjUy0xBCYdFAnNTWe-I) [selling](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470497416/ref=s9_simz_gw_s0_p14_i3?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=0KZBG7DRR50N2AJFNVHF&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=470938631&pf_rd_i=507846) [books](http://my.safaribooksonline.com/9780768683585/ch11lev1sec3)
