_This is part of the Peer Pressure Learning 30 series. Go read my [introduction to the experiment](/2010/06/11/peer-pressure-learning-experiment/) that [Miles](http://mileszs.com/) and I embarked on._

It's actually not too late in the evening and the whole family is asleep. It's a good time to hit the Clean Code! The next couple chapters will be interesting to write about. There are several extended case studies, so it's a change of pace. We'll see what comes out of them!

## Today's Reading: pg 177 - pg 186

Well, not a lot to say for this first portion of the chapter. I will say this, I read a ton of code and need more time to digest it. Another run-through tomorrow will help.

The following made me really happy I don't used Java:

> It's remarkable how much code is required to flesh out the details of this simple concept. One of the reasons for this is that we are using a particularly wordy language. Java, being a statically typed language, requires a lot of words in order to satisfy the type system. In a language like Ruby, Python, or Smalltalk, this program is much smaller.

I almost feel that to do this chapter justice, I should do just that; write it in Ruby. That way, I get a better feel for how it works and what's going on as the program changes. I think I'll lose too much in translation as I try to ignore the verbose nature of Java.
