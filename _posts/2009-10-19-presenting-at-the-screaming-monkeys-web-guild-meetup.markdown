I'll be presenting at the [Screaming Monkeys Web Guild meetup](http://www.meetup.com/screamingmonkeys/calendar/11659367/) this evening at 6pm:* Getting your web application up and running in minutes with [Heroku](http://heroku.com/)* Basic screencasting tips and techniquesWe will meet in the new [Northeast Indiana Innovation Center building](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&ll=41.12041,-85.098376&spn=0.003039,0.003932&t=h&z=18&msid=111936917137016682070.00047648a52d03727f3a9), thanks to [Cirrus ABS](http://cirrusabs.com). If you can't make the event tonight, check back in a few days as I should have a screencast of my presentation posted.Making magic with Heroku===![Heroku Logo](http://timharvey.net/wp-content/heroku_logo.png)Ruby has long been a challenging language to use for small web sites because of the work required to configure and manage hosting. The investment makes perfect sense for large-scale apps, but really bogs down the smaller projects.The last 12 months have seen tremendous strides in the ease of Ruby deployment and none more revolutionary than [Heroku](http://heroku.com/). I don't want to discount other contributions like mod_rails (also known as [Phusion Passenger](http://www.modrails.com/)) that will have longer-term impact. Despite the power of mod_rails, Heroku offers tremendous scalability, ease of entry, and incredibly fast deployment with almost no setup that's unmatched.I'll be covering some of the basics:* Overview* Publishing your app in less than 60 seconds* Creating separate staging and production deployments* Loading all your gems* Living with a read-only filesystem* Grabbing a copy of your databaseGetting started with screencasting===![Img Screenflow](http://timharvey.net/wp-content/img_screenflow.png)The Ruby on Rails community offers a [wealth of resources](http://railscasts.com) for [learning the framework](http://peepcode.com) via [screencasts](http://pragprog.com/). Rather than just reading a blog post or a set of steps, you see the complete process as well as parts of another programmers workflow. It's an incredibly powerful medium. I'll be taking a few minutes this evening to share my experiences creating screencasts and will share some tips on how to get started and avoid some of the frustrations I muddled through:* Basic software/hardware requirements* Workflow* Publishing options* Getting ideas / watching the mastersI have enjoyed creating screencasts for [my clients](http://www.literacy5.com/page/work/) and decided to experiment with using them as a presentation tool for my July talk with Mike Krisher on [version control with Git](/2009/07/20/screencast-simple-version-control-with-git/). Instead of trying to muddle through a rather complex demonstration real-time while trying to explain what was going on, I pre-recorded the demo. I didn't record any audio, so the voice-over was done in person (which is always preferable). I went back later and voiced-over the demo so that members who couldn't make the meetup would benefit from the demo.
